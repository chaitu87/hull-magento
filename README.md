## Benefits

This plugin enables a two-way sync between your magento userbase and your hull users.

It means that:

* your current Magento users will automatically have an associated hull user
* Your new users will be able to login with hull and will also be registered as regular Magento users.

## Beyond authentication

From that point, you can build hull-integrated magento plugins to enhance the engagement of your users
and ease the social spread of your e-commerce site.
